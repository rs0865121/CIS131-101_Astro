						<h2 class="text-success">Stars</h2>
						<h4>Stars are cosmic energy engines that produce heat, light, ultraviolet rays, x-rays, and other forms
						of radiation. They are composed largely of gas and plasma, a superheated state of matter composed of
						subatomic particles.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<h2 class="text-success">Appearance</h2>
						<h4>Some stars have always stood out from the rest. Their brightness is a factor of how much energy
						they put out–known as luminosity–and how far away from Earth they are. Stars in the heavens may also
						appear to be different colors because their temperatures are not all the same. Hot stars are white or blue,
						whereas cooler stars appear to have orange or red hues.</h4>

						<h2 class="text-success">Quantity</h2>
						<h4>No one knows how many stars exist, but the number would be staggering. Our universe likely contains more
						than 100 billion galaxies, and each of those galaxies may have more than 100 billion stars. Yet on a clear,
						dark night Earth's sky reveals only about 3,000 stars to the naked eye. Humans of many cultures have charted
						the heavens by these stars.</h4>

						<h2 class="text-success">Size</h2>
						<h4>Stars may occur in many sizes, which are classified in a range from dwarfs to
						supergiants. Supergiants may have radii a thousand times larger than that of our own sun. Though the
						larger a star's mass, the shorter its lifespan will be.</h4>
					</div>

					<div class="col-lg-6">
						<h2 class="text-success">Life Cycle</h2>
						<h3 onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='photos/protostar.jpg'" class="text-success">Protostars</h3>
						<h4>Young stars at this stage are called protostars. As they develop, they accumulate mass from the
						clouds around them and grow. As stars move toward the end of their lives much of their hydrogen
						has been converted to helium.</h4>
						<h3 onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='photos/redGiant.jpg'" class="text-success">Red Giants</h3>
						<h4>Helium sinks to the star's core and raises the star's temperature and size.
						These large, swelling stars are known as red giants. The red giant phase is a prelude to a star
						called a White Dwarf.</h4>
						<h3 onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='photos/whiteDwarf.jpg'" class="text-success">White Dwarfs</h3>
						<h4 onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='photos/realWhiteDwarf.png'">White dwarfs cool for billions of years, until they eventually go dark and produce
						no energy. At this point, which scientists have yet to observe, such stars become known as black dwarfs.
						Most stars instead go out with a bang. Such events are called Supernovae.</h4>
						<h3 onclick="document.getElementById('myImage').src='photos/neutronStar.jpg'" class="text-success">Neutron Stars</h3>
						<h4>These explosions leave behind a small core that may become a neutron star or even, if the remnant
						is large enough, a black hole.</h4>
