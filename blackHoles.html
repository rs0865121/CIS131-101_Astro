								<h4>Any black hole will have started out as an ordinary star. A star's mass is the sole factor that determines whether or not it will some day turn into a black hole. If a star contains enough mass
							it will undergo a violent explosion known as a supernova. A supernova leaves behind an extremely dense glowing star that is no longer undergoing nuclear fusion but is beginning its cooling-off phase.
							If this dense star core contains enough mass its gravity will overcome what's known as "neutron degeneracy pressure" and create a black hole. If the remaining star core does not contain enough mass, neutron
							degeneracy pressure is able to "push back" against the stars gravity and prevent itself from turning into a black hole. In this case, the star that doesn't turn into a black hole will then be referred to as a neutron star.</h4>

					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
					  <h3 class="text-success">Accretion Disk</h3>
					  <h4>In the case of a binary star system, it's possible for a black hole to possess an accretion disk. This means that if
					  a star and black hole are close enough, conditions might be right for the black hole's gravitational pull to extract mass from the neighboring star.
					  As the star's mass is siphoned off, the matter will form into an orbiting disk around the black hole. This accretion disk reaches extremely hot temperatures
					  and will eventually begin to emit X-ray radiation. As long as these X-ray's don't pass the event horizon, they will escape the pull of the black hole and travel
					  through the cosmos. This gives astronomers the chance to possibly identify the location of a black hole. It's important to remember that not all black holes are
					  a part of a binary star system and, therefore, will not always possess an accretion disk.</h4>

					  <h3 class="text-success">Event Horizon</h3>
					  <h4>The event horizon can be thought of as a definitive boundary for where a black hole begins. A black hole's gravity is so strong that anything, including light, which
					  passes over the event horizon into the black hole can not escape back out. Because light can not escape once it has passed the event horizon, nothing occuring within a black hole
					  is observable to astronomers. This leads astronomers to studying the effects a black hole has on its surroundings as the best way to learn the properties and behaviour of black holes.</h4>
					</div>
					<div class="col-lg-6">
					  <h3 class="text-success">Space-Time Curvature</h3>
					  <h4>Einstein's theory of general relativity taught us to think about space not as a flat plain with objects moving around on it, but as fabric (known as space-time) which is warped
					  by objects that exist within it. An easy analogy for this is to image a rubber sheet with objects of different masses and sizes scattered around it. The heavier and denser the object, the more
					  it will sink into the rubber sheet. A black hole would have so much mass concentrated into such a small area, it would create a bottemless pit on the rubber sheet. This is an effective analogy for
					  imagining a black hole but it's important to remember that this is a two-dimensional representation of space-time curvature. A spherical bottemless pit that could be approached from any
					  direction is closer to how an actual black hole effects space-time.</h4>

					 <h3 class="text-success">Singularity</h3>
					 <h4>If you could survive passing over the event horizon you would approach what is referred to as a "singularity". Because the event horizon prevents a singularity from being physically observed, we must rely on
					 our understanding of physics to explain the properties of one. The idea of a singularity can be summed up by understanding that nothing can counteract the gravity of a black hole. This means that
					 all matter within a black hole is compressed into an infinitely dense and infinitely small point. While this can be hard to imagine, it's important to remember that our mathematical understanding of black holes
					 and singularites makes us confident in our understanding of these occurences.</h4>
